# Subscription-Growth-Churn-Analysis-2020-2026
End-to-end subscription lifecycle and funnel analysis examining growth, churn, and retention trends (2020–2026) using Tableau, Excel, and SQL.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end **subscription growth, retention, and churn analysis** covering the period **2020–2026**, with a focus on how consumer subscription behaviour evolved during the COVID-19 surge and the subsequent market correction.

The analysis spans **multiple subscription categories**, including streaming, software, gaming, and digital services, to highlight differences in growth patterns, churn dynamics, and long-term retention trends across industries.

The dataset was compiled from publicly available industry statistics and market reports, then standardised and modelled to enable **comparative, time-series, and funnel-based analysis**. Some values are estimated or interpolated to maintain continuity and are intended to demonstrate **analytical reasoning, data modelling, and visual storytelling**, rather than serve as official market figures.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical analytics workflow: preparing data, analysing subscription lifecycles, and presenting insights through a clear, business-focused dashboard.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 2020–2021 saw an exceptional spike in subscriber growth, driven by lockdowns and increased demand for digital entertainment, productivity tools, and online services.
- Churn rates began rising from 2022 onward, indicating growing subscription fatigue as consumers reassessed discretionary spending.
- Streaming services experienced the highest volatility, with strong early growth followed by accelerated churn.
- Software and productivity subscriptions showed stronger long-term retention, reflecting higher perceived value and business dependency.
- Gaming subscriptions displayed more cyclical behaviour, with churn often influenced by pricing changes, content release cycles, and broader economic pressure.
- By 2025–2026, net subscriber growth stabilised or declined across most categories, signalling a more mature and competitive subscription market.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Subscription-based business models are highly sensitive to **churn, retention, and real-time revenue loss**. Even small failures in user experience or billing flows can materially impact revenue at scale.

This project demonstrates how analytics can be used to **monitor subscription health, identify early warning signals, and support data-driven decision-making** in subscription-driven businesses.
